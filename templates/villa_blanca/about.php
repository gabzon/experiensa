                Villa Blanca is a manorial mansion with views over the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the Maresme Coast, where the approximate minimum temperature between spring and autumn is 10 degrees Celsius, and the approximate maximum temperature is 30 degrees Celsius.

                The house is found inside a family-owned property of an area of 5 hectare, located 40 km away from Barcelona. It was built by a stock market agent, Marcelino Coll, and was later sold to Juan Pich i Pon, mayor of Barcelona and president of the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia’s regional government).

                It is surrounded by magnificent and romantic gardens designed by the famous architect Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Forestier. The house was built in 1909 and it is catalogued as a “protected building” by the Autonomous Regional Government of Catalonia.

                The property is well connected by both train and car with Barcelona and la Costa Brava. The Foundation for Environmental Education granted many years ago the Blue Flag to the wonderful beaches of Sant Vicenç de Montalt and Caldes d’Estrac for their high environmental and quality standards. These beaches are within walking distance.
